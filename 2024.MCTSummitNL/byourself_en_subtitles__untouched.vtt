00:00:03.117 --> 00:00:07.557
Good morning, that is so nice to be here. 

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:13.337
First of all, because before I forget it, thanks to the organizers, such an amazing event. 

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:17.897
I guess I'm allowed to say that since we're on the last day of the conference 

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:21.397
MCT Summit 2024: I love it. 

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.917
I gotta confess that I do like the Netherlands. 

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:30.577
Quite often here and somehow 

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:35.617
I really love 

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:38.617
that conference and you will see on a personal note 

00:00:38.617 --> 00:00:44.077
why that has a special meaning to me personally. We will talk about 

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.077
some tools, we will also talk about hardware, we will talk about some - let 

00:00:48.077 --> 00:00:53.557
me say soft skills and I want to pack that all in half an hour, so let me let 

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:56.017
me find out - let us find out with it if it works. 

00:00:56.117 --> 00:00:59.897
Before I forget that, there is a little poll out there. 

00:01:00.017 --> 00:01:02.597
I will publish the results later on. 

00:01:02.977 --> 00:01:06.537
There are QR codes, you might have seen that, they're all around the places. 

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:15.817
I will leave it open just after the talk and then I will post it to our signal group and such things. 

00:01:16.277 --> 00:01:18.417
Most of you will already have seen that. 

00:01:19.877 --> 00:01:27.297
Before we really start I need to tell you a little bit that's quite personal 

00:01:27.297 --> 00:01:33.617
because actually it took almost five years to deliver this talk. 

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:40.797
The first idea to talk about something like that was in 2019 when I was thinking 

00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:44.757
about what are the next challenges that we face, 

00:01:44.877 --> 00:01:54.417
the things that that you as an MCT will need to create your own version of the 2.0 version of an MCT. 

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:59.957
What does that mean in terms of YouTube, live streaming, talking on conferences, stuff like that? 

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:06.441
And what we planned, Denise and I, because I had the pleasure to work on that 

00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:11.401
with Denise McLaughlin, formerly known as Denise Humphreys, his lovely wife. 

00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.681
It is not exactly the same because it would be ludicrous four and a half years 

00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:20.701
later to talk about exactly the same things. 

00:02:21.061 --> 00:02:23.081
But it's very much comparable. 

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:29.721
The sad story is that Denise couldn't make it here, but I got you covered. 

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:36.141
Because what was so special? Why didn't we deliver that session in Vilnius? 

00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.001
Because that was what it should be. 

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:44.501
The answer is pretty easy. Just a couple of days after the videos that you will see in a minute, 

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:51.061
I was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, and I had to go through some 

00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:56.501
very severe medical treatment that took a while. 

00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:01.761
And that was the reason why I missed Vilnius and I also missed Switzerland so 

00:03:01.761 --> 00:03:07.261
that's the reason why four and a half years later I couldn't wait to deliver something like this. 

00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.581
Back in those days and that's the reason why I want to show you because Denise 

00:03:11.581 --> 00:03:17.961
is not here, we wanted to focus on a couple of microphones stuff like that, 

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.001
a little bit of hardware stuff and because Denise is such a funny person. 

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:28.281
I can't resist to simply show you as a prologue this few minute video. 

00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:31.861
So enjoy, and then we will talk about the serious stuff. 

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:33.881
Denise. 

00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:42.081
So here we are in Cologne. There are three important things to know about Cologne. 

00:03:42.081 --> 00:03:45.041
One: the Dom and here 

00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:50.221
we are at the back end fantastic we 

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:55.241
have got the Hauptbahnhof over here so I can catch a train quickly to go home and 

00:03:55.241 --> 00:04:04.461
to my right there is a band playing some Latin music and it's amazing. And this 

00:04:04.461 --> 00:04:10.041
is number two: Kölsch. I don't like it. Sion Kölsch is better. 

00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:21.561
Guess what? This is number three: the Rhine and we're on the Rhine Boulevard. 

00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:24.781
Fantastic view behind. 

00:04:29.197 --> 00:04:34.077
So the reason back then was that we wanted to show a couple of different types 

00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:37.557
of microphones and how we can enhance audio and stuff like that. 

00:04:37.597 --> 00:04:40.817
I will talk about that a little bit later, but that is the reason why we created 

00:04:40.817 --> 00:04:43.737
that demo videos. Back in those days, you both lived in Cologne. 

00:04:44.057 --> 00:04:47.077
You moved. You are real Europeans. 

00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:52.277
So I'm glad that Rolf made it here in the audience. Especially you. Thank you. 

00:04:54.457 --> 00:04:58.737
And I'm pretty sure we will plan something for the upcoming. 

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:02.337
MCT summit somewhere. So but now let's get serious. 

00:05:03.957 --> 00:05:07.337
Thanks for all the sponsors. Some of them are here in the room. 

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:09.217
Thank you for making it possible. 

00:05:09.457 --> 00:05:13.197
But again, thanks to the organizers and thank you to all the MCTs that paid for that, right? 

00:05:13.337 --> 00:05:18.457
So this is not a free event. So we're all somehow sponsors. That is important to say. 

00:05:21.297 --> 00:05:27.537
My name is Thorsten Butz. And as I told you, I got some serious medical treatment. 

00:05:27.537 --> 00:05:31.057
And as I already told you, I'm a big fan of the Netherlands. 

00:05:31.677 --> 00:05:36.557
And I thought, I've got to combine that thing. If you want to get back to life, 

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:37.437
you've got to do something. 

00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:42.157
So I decided to bike a little bit more than what I did before. 

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:46.397
And this is, some of the Dutch people might recognize this, this is a very famous 

00:05:46.397 --> 00:05:48.697
tour here in the Netherlands, the Elfstedentocht. 

00:05:49.037 --> 00:05:56.337
And usually you do that skating, but some of you do that by bike. and this is me last year,

00:05:56.417 --> 00:06:02.497
I did that a couple of times now, after 240 kilometers in a single day by the way. 

00:06:02.957 --> 00:06:10.297
So this is to (thank you) but this is nothing nothing better than show yourself 

00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:13.097
that you're still alive, right? So that's the best way to do that. 

00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:15.937
But let's talk about what you came for. 

00:06:17.417 --> 00:06:20.757
When do we talk about that. It's pretty simple because of that. 

00:06:22.057 --> 00:06:27.737
There's a great German word for that "Bandsalat". Everything that fails, 

00:06:27.737 --> 00:06:31.137
that can fail, will fail. That is my experience. 

00:06:32.197 --> 00:06:39.697
I'm an MCT for almost 25 years now. I started speaking in public more than a decade ago, 15 years. 

00:06:39.957 --> 00:06:46.757
I decided to do that a little bit more. Because if you talk, if we talk .. 

00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:51.057
For example, a while ago, Sami (Laiho) delivered a great talk about that. 

00:06:51.557 --> 00:06:58.617
And Sami, I remember well, said it is not about quantity, it is about quality. 

00:06:58.937 --> 00:07:02.917
So it really doesn't matter if you speak in front of 1,000 people, 

00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:05.537
they will not show up as customers. 

00:07:05.957 --> 00:07:11.317
But it might be on a special event that you simply have 20 or 30 people in the 

00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:14.817
audience, but they will return to you as customers. 

00:07:15.117 --> 00:07:19.957
So that is what I think about speaking in public. Doesn't mean that you have 

00:07:19.957 --> 00:07:25.337
one thousand people in the audience it can be a tiny group but that can be very important for, 

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:30.526
And you can also be the famous YouTuber that maybe Andy is becoming. 

00:07:30.926 --> 00:07:33.726
And that is your way you can do it. 

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:39.566
The problem is when you speak on big conferences, you might know that I'm now 

00:07:39.566 --> 00:07:41.786
for quite a couple of years, I'm 

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:45.526
responsible for audio and video at the PowerShell conference in Europe. 

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:51.066
I became in charge by accident. That is not what I was looking for. 

00:07:51.266 --> 00:07:54.186
The reason was: I was from day one, I was a speaker. 

00:07:54.406 --> 00:08:00.426
This was one of my favorite events. And what I found out is that you never get 

00:08:00.426 --> 00:08:04.646
100%. You can do whatever you want. Someone will screw it up. 

00:08:05.046 --> 00:08:11.246
Maybe the audio is missing. Maybe the screen recording is missing. Something will fail. 

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:16.046
And I thought, I have a right for my 15 minutes of fame. 

00:08:16.186 --> 00:08:21.866
So I want to take care, and I would encourage all of you to do exactly the same. 

00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:25.026
Record yourself and treat this as a backup. 

00:08:25.626 --> 00:08:29.026
Don't mind if everything works great, but if you have a backup, 

00:08:29.306 --> 00:08:31.806
you do not rely on the AV team. 

00:08:32.006 --> 00:08:34.866
And the good thing is the AV team will love you. 

00:08:35.046 --> 00:08:40.366
For example, some of you, I met a couple of you that will speak in the next 

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:42.666
upcoming PowerShell conference in Antwerp. 

00:08:43.086 --> 00:08:47.246
If you do a backup and we miss something, maybe the audio is broken, 

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:51.926
and you come to me and tell me, hey, I got my own personal recording, I will love you. 

00:08:52.286 --> 00:08:58.566
So that is my primary purpose why I started to create backups while I'm talking. 

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:02.386
And you will see, I did it with Ralph, you will see how that works. 

00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:08.826
Because everything, everyone I said, has his right for, his or her right for 

00:09:08.826 --> 00:09:12.006
his 15 minutes of fame, as Andy Warhol said it. 

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:15.966
And for those who are not familiar with PowerShell, This is Jeffrey Snover, 

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:17.146
the inventor of PowerShell. 

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:23.986
I had the joy that he came to a couple of my talks, but this was the first one. 

00:09:24.106 --> 00:09:26.526
And the topic was, yeah, you read it, right? 

00:09:26.826 --> 00:09:31.766
So this, I think this is my 15 minutes of fame. So I wanted to have it, 

00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:33.446
it's on YouTube. It's not the best quality. 

00:09:35.306 --> 00:09:38.106
I could do that better today, but it worked. 

00:09:40.415 --> 00:09:43.695
Let's start with some general advice very quickly. 

00:09:44.995 --> 00:09:48.495
This is from a colleague of ours. He's running a MacBook. 

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:56.715
And what you see up there is that he got a splitter because MacBooks are very 

00:09:56.715 --> 00:09:59.315
famous, and the same is true for Surface notebooks. 

00:09:59.975 --> 00:10:03.375
They are very, very famous that they screw up recording. 

00:10:03.775 --> 00:10:09.035
This is because of, read the Wikipedia article, this is because of HDCP. 

00:10:09.035 --> 00:10:20.095
It is meant to take care that you're not able to record yourself in terms of 

00:10:20.095 --> 00:10:22.475
audio and video duplication. 

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:30.155
They don't want that the latest Hollywood blockbuster shows up on YouTube one 

00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:32.775
day before it's broadcasted generally. 

00:10:34.535 --> 00:10:37.955
The cheaper the device the better. 

00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:46.835
If you buy that from that China Express store, you name it, for just two euros it will work because. 

00:10:48.715 --> 00:10:54.115
HDCP as far as I know requires some license 

00:10:54.115 --> 00:10:56.875
fee and they have to take care 

00:10:56.875 --> 00:11:01.795
about a couple of things and some of the cheap manufacturers they don't care 

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:08.195
about and that means that they simply tell the notebook we got you covered, everything 

00:11:08.195 --> 00:11:12.515
is fine everything is licensed give me the content so that will work and this 

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:15.175
colleague that I also recorded you will see him in a minute, 

00:11:16.435 --> 00:11:21.695
he had it with him and I would encourage you to try that on your own if you 

00:11:21.695 --> 00:11:25.715
have a MacBook if you have a Surface Book try recording yourself and if it works 

00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:29.075
great but buy this kind of device. 

00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:32.395
It's just a few euros.  

00:11:33.195 --> 00:11:40.855
Yeah, you name it. So generally, read about HDCP. So why do I tell? Because... 

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:47.693
It's more or less, it's a returning joke. Every year that we're recording something, 

00:11:48.293 --> 00:11:52.053
a couple of more people have macOS, a couple of more people have a new notebook, 

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.133
and then all of a sudden we can't record that. 

00:11:54.693 --> 00:12:00.853
So in many cases, the audio-video team got you covered, but it's always a good 

00:12:00.853 --> 00:12:04.153
idea to have one with you. That's the first point. 

00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:08.153
Second thing, always use FullHD. 

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:14.733
That's another thing that I see so often. People buy notebooks with such ridiculous 

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:17.453
screen resolution, which is nice when you work on it. 

00:12:18.353 --> 00:12:21.633
But this is not what you want to deliver to YouTube. 

00:12:21.993 --> 00:12:28.053
Forget about 4K these days. You can start with that maybe in a couple of years, 

00:12:28.173 --> 00:12:32.613
but today you will see FullHD is simply the sweet spot. 

00:12:32.793 --> 00:12:37.173
It's the gold standard. It will work everywhere. and I would encourage anyone 

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:44.693
to lower the resolution, try that, mirror the screen and deliver your content as FullHD. 

00:12:44.853 --> 00:12:46.833
And this is what the AV team expects. 

00:12:47.253 --> 00:12:53.753
So if you're doing home production then you might focus on higher resolutions. 

00:12:53.993 --> 00:12:57.413
But that is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about life situation. 

00:12:57.713 --> 00:12:59.513
I'm delivering FullHD here. 

00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:09.193
There are some more tips and tricks that are so - I think everybody should already know that - 

00:13:09.393 --> 00:13:13.293
but what I found out is people forget about that. 

00:13:13.473 --> 00:13:20.633
So, for example, put your phone in do not disturb mode and do not use the presenter 

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.633
mode because that always leads into trouble when mirroring screens. 

00:13:24.793 --> 00:13:27.293
If you know what you're doing, you can do any of that. 

00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:33.433
And a private tip from me, you might find out that it's a bit strange: w

00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:35.853
hy should we hide the clock? 

00:13:37.877 --> 00:13:42.417
Sometimes you screw it up, sometimes it fails and you need to cut it later on 

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:49.697
because nobody wants to see how you repair the cable or do something. 

00:13:50.137 --> 00:13:56.637
And then it's a bit annoying if the clock is moving from 1 o'clock to 3 o'clock or something like that. 

00:13:56.717 --> 00:14:02.177
So it's way easier to cut your video if you simply disable the clock in the tray bar. 

00:14:02.257 --> 00:14:06.737
That's a tiny trick, but it makes a big difference, I can tell you. 

00:14:06.737 --> 00:14:13.797
So probably turn off messenger and those type of things exactly if you enable 

00:14:13.797 --> 00:14:17.897
the presentation setting in Windows, then it should be covered, but anyhow. 

00:14:31.717 --> 00:14:35.157
Exactly. Sometimes it doesn't matter if you will have a look at that video if 

00:14:35.157 --> 00:14:40.957
if the recording will show up. So it's very likely that in two years' 

00:14:41.097 --> 00:14:44.317
time it is still the same that I would tell you because it doesn't change that 

00:14:44.317 --> 00:14:48.957
often in terms of microphone technology or audio interfaces or stuff like that. 

00:14:49.117 --> 00:14:54.097
Anyhow, the final thing that I don't see very often, I do it all the time, 

00:14:54.097 --> 00:15:00.937
maybe you saw it before we started, start with a jingle or start with a countdown. 

00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:06.857
But believe it or not, I very often have to cut sessions from speakers. 

00:15:07.117 --> 00:15:10.457
I don't name people here. Very, very prominent celebrities. 

00:15:11.197 --> 00:15:15.437
Very, very prominent. And you don't get the point in time where they start talking. 

00:15:15.637 --> 00:15:18.497
Because they're constantly chatting with someone. 

00:15:18.757 --> 00:15:22.077
And all of a sudden you think: Okay, this is already the talk. 

00:15:23.077 --> 00:15:26.457
Don't do that. In the beginning, shut up and do this. 

00:15:33.277 --> 00:15:37.717
And now you start. And now that is the distinct point where you say, 

00:15:37.797 --> 00:15:40.157
okay, that is the beginning of my presentation. 

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:43.197
Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. That's it. Very easy. 

00:15:45.385 --> 00:15:50.625
If you want to record yourself, it's obvious that it's easy somehow, 

00:15:50.825 --> 00:15:53.025
and it's very hard in some other aspects. 

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:57.045
What I want to show you is that you only need to cover two things. 

00:15:57.585 --> 00:16:02.665
And if you're looking for a little bit more, then you have to cover three things. 

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:04.045
Let's find out what that is. 

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:09.805
What you really need is screen recording. And it really doesn't hurt anyone 

00:16:09.805 --> 00:16:12.845
if you do a screen recording as a backup.  

00:16:12.965 --> 00:16:19.605
As I mentioned before, if the audio video team on a conference has got some 

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:24.525
trouble with the connection, stuff like that, it's just so easy to record your screen. 

00:16:25.745 --> 00:16:30.565
What you already should take care of is audio. 

00:16:30.825 --> 00:16:35.605
This is the reason why you see that I wear a microphone, because that is very important. 

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:43.025
The one thing that I think is not so really important important is the thumbnail 

00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:45.825
size of your head, that headshot. 

00:16:46.965 --> 00:16:51.265
Because if you think about, if you have a look at the PowerShell training or 

00:16:51.265 --> 00:16:55.845
something like that on a conference, just that I mentioned. How important is 

00:16:55.845 --> 00:16:56.965
that you see the speaker? 

00:16:57.725 --> 00:17:02.825
It's nice to have because it gives you some of the atmosphere at the conference. 

00:17:03.265 --> 00:17:07.065
It's very nice to have, but actually you don't need it. 

00:17:08.245 --> 00:17:13.305
Sometimes I think it's a little bit disgusting if I see a huge amount of code 

00:17:13.305 --> 00:17:18.085
and some of it overlaps with a picture of the speaker. 

00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:23.145
So if I cut it on my own then I always remove the camera. 

00:17:23.645 --> 00:17:29.085
So I want you, if you start recording with it, don't think too much about video. 

00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:33.865
Simply think about screen recording plus audio and that is already a great backup 

00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:35.405
for anything that you do. 

00:17:37.364 --> 00:17:40.344
Screen recording is not a big thing. 

00:17:41.164 --> 00:17:45.884
And I have to say, first of all, that I'm not sponsored by any of the companies 

00:17:45.884 --> 00:17:49.824
that I will name now, and I will name a lot, and I will give recommendation. 

00:17:50.344 --> 00:17:54.384
I'm open to sponsoring, if you listen. 

00:17:55.944 --> 00:18:01.944
Camtasia, RØDE, and stuff like that. But this is just my personal experience. 

00:18:02.184 --> 00:18:06.904
So Camtasia, to me, is number one, simply because we're at the MCT Summit. 

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:10.764
And I know that almost any one of you already have a Camtasia license. 

00:18:11.084 --> 00:18:15.224
So if you have one: start it, it's fine. It's great. And you can also cut it. 

00:18:16.184 --> 00:18:19.904
It's available for macOS. It's available for Windows. Great tool. 

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:25.584
The easiest thing, maybe you have not yet seen it, is: ZoomIt

00:18:26.124 --> 00:18:31.844
In the latest versions, it was, I think, Mark Russinovich published it last year. 

00:18:32.224 --> 00:18:37.984
It can also do screen recording. and I definitely I'm sure any one of you have 

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:39.824
these Sysinternals tools on your notebook. 

00:18:40.084 --> 00:18:43.644
It is CTRL+F5 - that's it, let it run, it's fine. 

00:18:44.524 --> 00:18:52.504
And if you really want to go serious then it must be OBS because OBS is the prime tool. 

00:18:53.124 --> 00:18:58.924
It is not very hard to understand but it needs some time to try out. 

00:18:59.084 --> 00:19:02.864
So the nice thing thing about OBS is, I use it here,

00:19:03.144 --> 00:19:08.184
the nice thing about OBS is that it is available for any platform that we use. 

00:19:08.284 --> 00:19:11.404
It's available for Linux, for Windows, and for macOS, so it's always the same. 

00:19:11.764 --> 00:19:16.304
And if you want to go into live streaming, that's where it comes from, 

00:19:16.344 --> 00:19:17.224
but it can do everything. 

00:19:17.424 --> 00:19:22.524
I use it in any Teams recording because it's got virtual cameras and so many 

00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:26.164
useful things. Do it, try it, that is the easiest part. 

00:19:28.924 --> 00:19:33.184
The one thing that you're usually missing, why we wanted to talk about that 

00:19:33.184 --> 00:19:38.284
topic is, the one thing that people do not know is that they need an audio interface. 

00:19:39.324 --> 00:19:44.484
Some of you might think, I got that little jack here, I can plug it in in my 

00:19:44.484 --> 00:19:46.604
notebook and that's it. That will not work. 

00:19:47.464 --> 00:19:55.444
Because computers are not very good in processing audio signals because they 

00:19:55.444 --> 00:19:57.284
expect you to have such a device. 

00:19:57.644 --> 00:20:01.064
And if you look closely, you will see there are three audio interfaces. 

00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:06.926
I have not took a picture of my biggest audio interface that is of this size, 

00:20:07.126 --> 00:20:08.966
if you do music and stuff like that. 

00:20:09.666 --> 00:20:15.846
But the biggest one is a general general purpose audio device, a good one. 

00:20:17.226 --> 00:20:22.066
The smallest one, the white one, you already know because that is nothing else 

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:25.866
than the Apple adapter, that some of you might know. 

00:20:26.326 --> 00:20:31.106
And the one in the middle, that is the most interesting one on the right hand 

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:32.686
side, that is the RØDE micro AI. 

00:20:32.946 --> 00:20:35.306
This is what I will recommend later on. 

00:20:35.986 --> 00:20:42.686
The interesting thing about that Apple adapter is that some of you might think 

00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:47.766
that this is simply a passive thing, just a cable. It is not. 

00:20:48.146 --> 00:20:51.846
It got tons of electronic circuit in it. It's a miracle. 

00:20:52.226 --> 00:20:59.166
And the fun thing is that this might be the cheapest, in terms of value, 

00:20:59.526 --> 00:21:04.126
the cheapest thing that Apple ever created, because it only cost 10 euros. 

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:07.626
And if you think about it, if you read about it, what's all in it

00:21:10.346 --> 00:21:15.446
hen compared to some cables that they sell for 30 euros: This must be way more 

00:21:15.446 --> 00:21:16.886
expensive, but we don't tell them. 

00:21:17.126 --> 00:21:24.926
So one day they started to, when they moved to Lightning and to Lightning only, 

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:30.626
so when they removed the jack, they started to offer that in a cheap way, 

00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:36.066
and they still offer it for 10 euros, and you get it on the used market for even less. 

00:21:37.106 --> 00:21:40.946
And this will also work with most Android phones. 

00:21:41.606 --> 00:21:45.586
And I got a lot of things with me. If you have an Android phone, 

00:21:45.746 --> 00:21:49.146
I would really love to talk to you and give a couple of things so that you can 

00:21:49.146 --> 00:21:52.866
tell me this works with my device, this works with that device. 

00:21:53.146 --> 00:21:57.506
I tested it with a Galaxy, for example. Many will have that. 

00:21:57.766 --> 00:22:02.986
That works fine. And that is the cheapest one. You can buy much more expensive 

00:22:02.986 --> 00:22:06.346
stuff than this that will not work that well. 

00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:13.317
I will come to that later. The fun thing is that Andy, for example, 

00:22:13.377 --> 00:22:14.857
asked me exactly about that. 

00:22:15.477 --> 00:22:21.677
What you really need to know in terms of technical is that the jack / 

00:22:21.957 --> 00:22:27.737
the pin might always look the same. We're talking about 3.5 millimeter jacks. 

00:22:28.157 --> 00:22:31.897
But it is not the same. It's a large number of standards. 

00:22:32.737 --> 00:22:36.117
And I don't go into much detail here. We will not have the time. 

00:22:36.117 --> 00:22:42.917
But what you really should be aware of, count the rings and you will see these 

00:22:42.917 --> 00:22:44.157
both pins are different. 

00:22:44.857 --> 00:22:52.957
The upper one is a so-called TRS jack, a TRS pin and the lower one is a TRRS. 

00:22:53.377 --> 00:22:54.677
Why is that different? 

00:22:55.577 --> 00:23:01.697
The management summary is the lower one supports microphone plus headphones. 

00:23:02.557 --> 00:23:11.217
That's the reason why most most smartphones will expect you to have something with TRRS. 

00:23:11.577 --> 00:23:13.477
So that leads to the situation, 

00:23:14.277 --> 00:23:18.097
if you buy a very expensive lapel mic, I'll come to that later, 

00:23:18.837 --> 00:23:22.657
and you put it in here and attach it to your smartphone, it will not work. 

00:23:22.977 --> 00:23:28.177
Because the expensive ones, they are not meant to be directly used with headphones. 

00:23:28.957 --> 00:23:33.497
They think that you have some proper musician gear or some broadcasting gear. 

00:23:33.497 --> 00:23:38.657
So very often the expensive one use the TRS standard, the upper one, 

00:23:38.817 --> 00:23:43.677
and the cheaper one, those that I gave to you, they use TRRS. 

00:23:45.431 --> 00:23:49.951
You can move from one to the other, but then you're in the dongle hell. 

00:23:50.251 --> 00:23:53.291
And you will see that very often when you find me on conferences. 

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:59.231
I always run with a bunch of these cables here because this is TRS to TRRS and vice versa. 

00:23:59.491 --> 00:24:02.471
And you need them. So I have a couple of them with me. 

00:24:02.911 --> 00:24:07.711
And you will later find - I will put everything with affiliate links - 

00:24:07.811 --> 00:24:12.031
with links to the standards and stuff in the slide deck. 

00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:16.551
And I will publish it. So you might take pictures, but there is no necessity. 

00:24:16.811 --> 00:24:23.111
I will give you the links and some tips and tricks. Take your time. It doesn't matter. 

00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:26.271
That is the one thing that you have to be aware and, a

00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:33.251
s most of you already know, I donated this. This is for free. 

00:24:33.311 --> 00:24:39.071
You can keep it. I gave it to some of you if you don't have one take one use it. 

00:24:39.191 --> 00:24:44.151
This one has TRRS. So this is what is expected here on a smartphone. 

00:24:44.351 --> 00:24:49.131
This is a very cheap lapel mic and we will see what comes out in a couple of minutes. 

00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:57.631
This is what it looks like. You have a smartphone and since I'm an Apple user, 

00:24:57.791 --> 00:25:01.931
Apple makes it easy for me because it's always the same. 

00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:06.831
I don't mind that you use Android but there might be a difference if you use 

00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:13.691
a Galaxy phone from Samsung or you use a Huawei or Xiaomi or whatsoever. So try that out. 

00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:23.051
The question is, if you got everything wired, how do you record yourself? 

00:25:23.731 --> 00:25:32.171
If I go back one more time, on the left hand side you see there is a recording application. 

00:25:33.051 --> 00:25:38.251
You can use anything. You can use a voice recorder, you can use anything that you 

00:25:38.251 --> 00:25:41.511
find but i highly recommend for apple users, 

00:25:43.331 --> 00:25:46.171
sadly that is not on the Google store it is 

00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:49.591
on the store yes but it's only for outdated android 

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:54.431
versions so for the latest and greatest you will not find it. But for ios users 

00:25:54.431 --> 00:25:59.491
i highly recommend this app you see here it's aphonic we will talk about that 

00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:05.831
and you can simply use it to record And the main reason why I recommend it is 

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:08.131
you can choose the microphone. 

00:26:08.791 --> 00:26:15.751
Because in my current setup, I have four microphones, if I got it right, 

00:26:16.031 --> 00:26:18.751
that are connected to my smartphone. 

00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:23.311
Because I have a couple of them built in, and I attach another one, 

00:26:23.391 --> 00:26:25.791
so I can choose from three or four or whatsoever. 

00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:31.371
And this doesn't work properly automatically. You should really check that. 

00:26:31.371 --> 00:26:34.091
And Auphonic allows you to check that. 

00:26:34.731 --> 00:26:39.851
That is also true for some other tools, but this is the one that I use. 

00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:46.555
What is Auphonic? Auphonic is a dream come true. 

00:26:46.615 --> 00:26:50.975
You will see that in the little demo that I prepared. 

00:26:51.875 --> 00:26:57.535
Auphonic is, and now comes the best, it's a free service from our friends in Austria. 

00:26:57.755 --> 00:27:00.675
It is somehow related to a university over there. 

00:27:01.175 --> 00:27:10.635
They're doing research on audio signals and they are, These guys are world-class 

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:14.635
experts on audio processing. It is the highest level. 

00:27:15.275 --> 00:27:19.575
And they do offer a broadcasting service, let me say it like that, 

00:27:20.415 --> 00:27:24.115
where you can put in your totally rubbish audio signal. 

00:27:24.155 --> 00:27:27.075
You can also put in videos. You will see in a couple of minutes. 

00:27:28.275 --> 00:27:32.195
And then they try to improve it. they also 

00:27:32.195 --> 00:27:35.915
these days they create a transcript and 

00:27:35.915 --> 00:27:39.595
if you want to you get automated subtitles it 

00:27:39.595 --> 00:27:42.875
is great you will see that I always 

00:27:42.875 --> 00:27:47.975
use that because it makes it so easy to publish something for example to YouTube 

00:27:47.975 --> 00:27:55.815
on conferences I very often tell that we have one more time I take this as an 

00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:59.635
example because I I know a lot about it. I take the PowerShell conference. 

00:27:59.835 --> 00:28:03.955
We have almost 100 sessions, 80-something. 

00:28:04.895 --> 00:28:12.635
And if everything works great, I can publish all of them in three days. And how can that be? 

00:28:13.655 --> 00:28:16.575
I delivered a couple of talks. You will find them on YouTube. 

00:28:16.915 --> 00:28:20.175
But the management summary is: I couldn't do without Auphonic. 

00:28:20.575 --> 00:28:22.855
Because I put everything in a cloud storage. 

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:30.055
I automatically let improve it here. and they will publish it on behalf of me to YouTube. 

00:28:30.555 --> 00:28:35.395
So that's it. And then you can say that it's automatically visible or not. 

00:28:35.555 --> 00:28:39.735
I always say upload it, but don't make it visible, and then I check it again, 

00:28:39.815 --> 00:28:42.735
and then I put it to public. 

00:28:43.175 --> 00:28:46.415
I show you a demo in a few seconds. 

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:53.275
What should you buy if you're interested? In that, what I will demo with the 

00:28:53.275 --> 00:28:55.015
help of Ralph in a couple of seconds. 

00:28:57.375 --> 00:29:01.175
And what you should not buy. And again, I'm not paid for that. 

00:29:01.895 --> 00:29:03.755
So that is really my experience. 

00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:09.185
Do not buy any of the cheap or not so cheap adapters. 

00:29:09.465 --> 00:29:19.005
I bought them to try them out, but usually they are made for supporting headphones and only headphones. 

00:29:19.285 --> 00:29:22.545
Most of them do not support microphones. 

00:29:22.985 --> 00:29:24.145
They are not meant for that. 

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:31.025
So if you buy anything, simply try if it works or not, I would recommend that 

00:29:31.025 --> 00:29:32.165
you buy something different. 

00:29:32.905 --> 00:29:36.045
If you only want to spend 10 euros then take 

00:29:36.045 --> 00:29:38.865
the microphone that I gave to you which is 

00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:42.485
by the way less than less than 

00:29:42.485 --> 00:29:45.165
two euros. This microphone costs on the 

00:29:45.165 --> 00:29:48.025
China market just one euro something and then 

00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:51.185
the rest is parcel service and how 

00:29:51.185 --> 00:29:54.245
good it is you will hear that. Buy this 

00:29:54.245 --> 00:29:57.665
one. And Apple is rich enough it's not 

00:29:57.665 --> 00:30:00.705
that I want them to be even richer it is just because I made 

00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:06.385
the best experience with that. That is why I recommend that but since you are 

00:30:06.385 --> 00:30:12.345
all rich I want you to think about and this is exactly what you asked me, Andy. A

00:30:12.345 --> 00:30:17.825
nd I want you to think about trying the, 

00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:21.165
I put the notes and they I put the 

00:30:21.165 --> 00:30:26.125
link in the notes try the RØDE AI micro. You see it on the left hand 

00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:34.165
side this is this one over there it is as big as a stamp and it's a miracle 

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:38.725
because there are a couple of things that are really great in it. 

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:44.105
First of all it supports two microphones and it handles as different channels 

00:30:44.105 --> 00:30:52.025
so I can for my podcast for example I can create a two-person interview and 

00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:53.205
I have separated channels. 

00:30:53.505 --> 00:30:58.945
That is first of all super great. The next thing is you have headphones support 

00:30:58.945 --> 00:31:04.805
on top and the the very, very best thing is, do you see the microphone? 

00:31:05.025 --> 00:31:09.365
Some, one of it, the red one is TRRS and the other one is TRS. 

00:31:10.998 --> 00:31:15.458
You can put both of it into, it will recognize automatically. That is pure magic. 

00:31:15.878 --> 00:31:20.038
You know, I always say content first, recording second!

00:31:20.518 --> 00:31:23.498
If you're on a big stage, don't screw it up because of the recording. 

00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:28.758
Deliver your session. It is better that you deliver a good session than you 

00:31:28.758 --> 00:31:30.298
have a good recording of a bad session. 

00:31:31.018 --> 00:31:34.238
So you don't want to fiddle around. 

00:31:35.118 --> 00:31:39.598
So take the simplest way that can be. And if you buy this one, 

00:31:39.758 --> 00:31:46.238
again, not an advertisement, but I got very, very good experience with that. 

00:31:47.198 --> 00:31:48.178
That's my recommendation. 

00:31:50.298 --> 00:31:59.178
If you want to buy another lapel mic, you can spend money on it, infinite money on it. 

00:31:59.538 --> 00:32:02.338
But the one thing that I started with is this one. 

00:32:02.378 --> 00:32:06.038
This is, again, a RØDE product. I got to confess that I'm a bit addicted to 

00:32:06.038 --> 00:32:08.318
that company because they're in that sweet spot. 

00:32:08.598 --> 00:32:16.378
They're not too expensive. Because real pro gear can be super expensive if you 

00:32:16.378 --> 00:32:21.918
think about the news on television It's disgusting what they pay for microphones. 

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:29.378
We don't want to go into that area. It can be a couple of thousand euros for a microphone. 

00:32:29.598 --> 00:32:35.278
That's not a problem at all so this one is only 60 euros this is the RØDE smart

00:32:35.278 --> 00:32:39.138
lav+ and this also has TRRS you see. 

00:32:40.338 --> 00:32:43.338
hat means it is meant to be connected 

00:32:43.338 --> 00:32:46.478
to a smartphone but even better 

00:32:46.478 --> 00:32:50.918
if you say that doesn't convince me because what do 

00:32:50.918 --> 00:32:53.698
i do with my smartphone while it's 

00:32:53.698 --> 00:32:57.458
connected  i want to move around right and 

00:32:57.458 --> 00:33:02.578
if I have it here on the desk I can't do it. This is the reason why I also gave 

00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:06.218
you that little stand because that might be okay if you don't want to go around 

00:33:06.218 --> 00:33:12.498
but if you want to move around then you need something like that. Fhat is where 

00:33:12.498 --> 00:33:17.238
Ralph comes into this session and you might see here, 

00:33:18.378 --> 00:33:24.118
there is a there is a wireless transmitter and this is the one that I used. 

00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:28.858
The audience in the room will see what I point 

00:33:28.858 --> 00:33:30.258
to you don't see it on the recording. 

00:33:32.038 --> 00:33:37.978
This is a wireless transmitter and this is what I use and this is what we did 

00:33:37.978 --> 00:33:42.538
while I recorded the session that you will see in a minute and I also recorded 

00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:46.258
the session a couple of other colleagues for example Andy's. 

00:33:46.858 --> 00:33:52.858
I will show you two colleagues that texted me me first. 

00:33:53.138 --> 00:33:56.118
The first one was Ralph and the second one you will also see. 

00:33:56.198 --> 00:34:00.538
So I take them as a demo to show you what we've done here. 

00:34:01.098 --> 00:34:05.698
So before I go back to the wireless transmitter, let's have a, 

00:34:08.144 --> 00:34:15.264
Let's see what we've done there. I show you one thing first. I got a one minute clip. 

00:34:16.064 --> 00:34:20.344
Hope time is enough. Yeah, we're fine in time. And the first thing that you 

00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:29.824
will see is that I recorded Ralph with a high value, very pricey lapel mic. 

00:34:29.924 --> 00:34:32.744
Also from RØDE , the Lavalier II. This is the best 

00:34:32.744 --> 00:34:39.284
that I have and this is what came out when I don't touch it when I do not improve 

00:34:39.284 --> 00:34:45.124
it this is just the untouched audio recording so wait.  

00:35:17.184 --> 00:35:24.204
First one. You see it's quite noisy and you have to keep something in mind. 

00:35:24.904 --> 00:35:29.424
The main stage below is a little bit awkward in terms of recording because you 

00:35:29.424 --> 00:35:31.304
have that feedback loop from the PA. 

00:35:31.884 --> 00:35:37.064
The whole room is completely noisy, so that's not a lot of fun in terms of recording. 

00:35:37.564 --> 00:35:41.944
I will show you another example from this room where we are now. 

00:35:42.084 --> 00:35:44.724
It's way easier to record. But let me show you, 

00:35:46.647 --> 00:35:52.507
This is the microphone which only costs less than 2 euros and mind the difference. 

00:36:12.187 --> 00:36:20.367
Not that big of a difference, right? It's not 100 times better or less good. But I got one more thing. 

00:36:21.207 --> 00:36:27.627
I always recommend that you also record the microphone of your notebook. 

00:36:27.907 --> 00:36:29.387
Most of you will have one. 

00:36:30.527 --> 00:36:35.487
And the quality will be very bad. But later on, when you cut the video, 

00:36:35.747 --> 00:36:41.587
you will have to find out you got an external source, an audio file and you 

00:36:41.587 --> 00:36:48.507
have to combine it eventually with a screen recording. 

00:36:49.027 --> 00:36:53.827
And how do you find out what is the proper position to align these both? 

00:36:54.027 --> 00:37:00.687
So I always recommend that you also include the notebook microphone so that 

00:37:00.687 --> 00:37:04.967
it's easier to cut it and when you align it then you silence the notebook. 

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:11.067
And just for comparison, and keep your ears shut, what does that sound like? 

00:37:29.927 --> 00:37:32.347
What you hear is the PA. 

00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:37.727
Because without the PA you wouldn't hear him not 

00:37:37.727 --> 00:37:40.647
like that because he moved away from from the notebook 

00:37:40.647 --> 00:37:46.207
and it would be even worse so and now we show you something you put that file 

00:37:46.207 --> 00:37:56.027
into Auphonic and I have it here let's see this you go to productions I already 

00:37:56.027 --> 00:38:00.487
uploaded it I want to just want to show you one little thing. I hope it works here. 

00:38:02.627 --> 00:38:04.947
Ah, maybe I'm not super online. 

00:38:07.247 --> 00:38:07.867
What's up? 

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:11.650
roductions. 

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:20.510
This is a live situation, right? I should have taken a screenshot but anyhow it doesn't matter. 

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.990
Okay, I can tell you what you would see here. 

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:29.230
You simply push it up. Now it's here. 

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.250
You simply push it up to a 

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:36.170
cloud storage or you can also directly upload it 

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.150
and then you can do 

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.950
a lot of things and you see you 

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:46.450
can put the title of the track into it so that it automatically gets 

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.850
the right YouTube title stuff like that but the real magic is 

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:55.970
this here underneath and this 

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.890
is these audio algorithms that you see here below there 

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.870
are pure magic and within the last year 

00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:04.990
they added augmented they added 

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:07.770
artificial intelligence to it and if 

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.490
you think about the documentary that you might have seen about the 

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.370
Beatles the reason why we see that 

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:20.510
is just audio processing next level that is because artificial intelligence 

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:32.310
was used to to to recognize the noise and remove it without lowering the frequencies of the voice. 

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:39.470
And it's just amazing. If you think about it, the Beatles, that was 69, 70. It's amazing. 

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.090
And you can use that here. 

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:48.570
And what you can also use is what I automatically added, and you will see the result here. 

00:39:51.250 --> 00:40:01.170
Auphonic integrates the Whisper system. Whisper is something that you might have heard of. 

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:07.470
It is from OpenAI, the ChatGPT guys, and it delivers automatic subtitles. 

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.650
It can do a bunch of things. If you look at my YouTube videos you will find 

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.570
out there are summaries. 

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:18.930
They are created by the Whisper because think about it, three days for almost 

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:23.350
100 talks, each of them an hour, how can that be? 

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:27.710
I would need an army of people to process that video. 

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.850
That is done by Whisper. And now I show you what's coming up here. 

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.230
And take your seat. 

00:40:37.376 --> 00:40:40.956
This is the the resulting file i have not yet uploaded it because it's ralph's content, 

00:40:42.076 --> 00:40:48.196
but take care. 

00:41:17.076 --> 00:41:23.836
Unbelievable, isn't it? There's no noise in it and that was the expensive microphone. 

00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:31.936
The real magic, now we listen to the one euro something microphone.  

00:42:00.596 --> 00:42:02.396
Unbelievable, right? Have you heard any? 

00:42:02.736 --> 00:42:08.436
I checked it, I guess, I checked it four times because I thought I had confused 

00:42:08.436 --> 00:42:11.016
the files. I have not. Exported it multiple times. 

00:42:11.396 --> 00:42:15.916
It's unbelievable, right? So what you find out is that I very often see that 

00:42:15.916 --> 00:42:18.596
people invest in very, very expensive microphones. 

00:42:19.376 --> 00:42:25.156
But what you see here is the audio interface is the first thing that you should buy. 

00:42:25.296 --> 00:42:28.436
That is my personal recommendation. I got one more thing. 

00:42:29.376 --> 00:42:31.376
Do you remember the notebook sound? 

00:42:33.696 --> 00:42:40.076
It is not as good. That's for granted. But if you don't have anything else, 

00:42:40.236 --> 00:42:42.536
and that was your 15 minutes of fame. 

00:42:57.325 --> 00:43:01.845
I stop it here. It's amazing. That is Auphonic. So I give a big hand to Auphonic. 

00:43:01.925 --> 00:43:03.625
It's great. And it's for free. 

00:43:04.805 --> 00:43:10.765
It is for free. Thank you, Austria. You can use it two hours a month for free. 

00:43:11.385 --> 00:43:14.945
So if you're someone like, let's say, Tiago, our friend MCT, 

00:43:14.965 --> 00:43:20.485
Tiago Costa, and some of you constantly talk on, that might not be enough, 

00:43:20.605 --> 00:43:22.865
but for me it's almost enough. 

00:43:23.005 --> 00:43:25.965
You can pay a little bit. It's just a few euros. Thank you. 

00:43:28.545 --> 00:43:33.345
But it is free. And the whisper system, for example, is also free. 

00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:36.105
Completely free. I want to show you one last thing. 

00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:43.865
This is what Camtasia looks like. And if Ralph and the colleagues allow, 

00:43:44.125 --> 00:43:49.525
I put the demo files, unprocessed everything, I put it into a cloud storage 

00:43:49.525 --> 00:43:52.245
and I will link it so you can try that on your own. 

00:43:52.965 --> 00:43:58.385
And I will also take a note which microphone did I use which audio interface 

00:43:58.385 --> 00:44:03.805
because I changed it multiple times to make a good demo this is, 

00:44:04.405 --> 00:44:11.485
unprocessed audio from this room no auphonic and listen to it ".. has so many settings 

00:44:11.485 --> 00:44:16.045
it's not possible at all to configure a control a setting through you write 

00:44:16.045 --> 00:44:19.065
a script you will sit down in the night and write scripts and then test and deploy. 

00:44:19.565 --> 00:44:26.005
So thankfully, Apple has a project which is called Mac OS Security Compliance Project. 

00:44:26.325 --> 00:44:31.945
It is a project which is available on GitHub. It's an open source project. 

00:44:32.365 --> 00:44:39.345
And it has been developed by Apple itself, along with many high security agencies 

00:44:39.345 --> 00:44:43.405
like NASA, CIA, and the US Defense Organization. 

00:44:43.745 --> 00:44:45.445
They have... " So much, thank you. 

00:44:45.945 --> 00:44:49.445
You see he got two microphones wired so that 

00:44:49.445 --> 00:44:52.645
is just the one I tested to that 

00:44:52.645 --> 00:44:59.245
is again the cheap one so I really like it and that was also one of the reason 

00:44:59.245 --> 00:45:03.445
so that I wanted you to test it and I still want you to test it because we got 

00:45:03.445 --> 00:45:08.365
one more almost a complete day if you want to try it today and do yourself a 

00:45:08.365 --> 00:45:11.065
favor thank you and simply try it so. 

00:45:12.404 --> 00:45:19.324
If you're rich, if you're a security expert and you do not know what to spend 

00:45:19.324 --> 00:45:25.044
with your money, I would highly recommend that you use a wireless transmitter and a little tripod. 

00:45:25.504 --> 00:45:30.204
And what you saw from the picture when we were down in the hall. 

00:45:31.004 --> 00:45:37.204
You can't always use a tripod just like this because there were plenty of people walking around. 

00:45:37.204 --> 00:45:43.864
You might have seen on the picture, I go back so that you remember. Do you see this? 

00:45:44.344 --> 00:45:46.924
I bought this to be totally independent. 

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:51.864
So I just simply put it on the desk if I can. 

00:45:52.324 --> 00:45:56.424
And it's just about the audio recording. I don't care too much about the video. 

00:45:56.484 --> 00:46:00.604
I'm not that nice guy so that everybody needs to see me. 

00:46:00.644 --> 00:46:06.284
But I hope I got some content and this should be heard and my screen recording should be seen. 

00:46:06.284 --> 00:46:09.784
So you can get that on the 

00:46:09.784 --> 00:46:16.044
used market and I think they will not produce this anymore there will be new 

00:46:16.044 --> 00:46:22.544
versions you can buy other stuff but do yourself a favor and stay away from 

00:46:22.544 --> 00:46:27.304
Bluetooth. If you want to know more about Bluetooth and why you should not use 

00:46:27.304 --> 00:46:29.444
it, talk to me after the session. 

00:46:30.124 --> 00:46:31.844
Bluetooth is not meant to be for 

00:46:31.844 --> 00:46:37.004
that purpose so the Bluetooth stuff is almost rubbish. It is not meant for that. 

00:46:37.084 --> 00:46:41.084
You can have a telephone call, but don't use a wireless transmitter just like this. 

00:46:41.184 --> 00:46:44.384
There are competing products that is not an issue. 

00:46:44.884 --> 00:46:52.264
So I paid 300 euros or something like that, but you can easily get it on the 

00:46:52.264 --> 00:46:57.004
used market because due to corona, many, many people bought it, 

00:46:57.744 --> 00:46:58.344
but they're not satisfied. 

00:46:59.603 --> 00:47:02.523
Because they have not yet bought an audio interface. You know what I mean? 

00:47:02.563 --> 00:47:06.523
The quality is poor if you attach it directly to the notebook. 

00:47:06.963 --> 00:47:11.523
And so you will find, I recently found a pair for 50 euros in Germany. 

00:47:11.983 --> 00:47:16.743
So you will, without any problems, you will find one for 100 euros. I highly recommend. 

00:47:16.903 --> 00:47:22.843
And you can borrow one from me if you deliver a session later today. I gladly record you. 

00:47:24.283 --> 00:47:28.623
So that is what I wanted to show you. and I'm really really looking forward 

00:47:28.623 --> 00:47:34.583
to talk to you and yeah discuss your your experience. Any questions? 

00:47:35.943 --> 00:47:40.183
"The most problem I have is that my storage is full on my phone or on my iPad."

00:47:41.023 --> 00:47:47.563
Storage is full. Yes. Buy a bigger phone. Buy a bigger one. But what I use is 

00:47:47.563 --> 00:47:48.623
your portable hand recorder. 

00:47:49.563 --> 00:47:53.803
The Zoom Z1. What's your opinion about that? You can use that. 

00:47:53.803 --> 00:47:59.743
The reason why I use a smartphone is pretty easy to explain. 

00:47:59.743 --> 00:48:03.023
Because and you might 

00:48:03.023 --> 00:48:06.943
think that a proper camera for 2,000 

00:48:06.943 --> 00:48:12.863
euros is better no it is not because the problem with cameras is they are not 

00:48:12.863 --> 00:48:19.783
meant for recording video so they will overheat and that will not work for an 

00:48:19.783 --> 00:48:26.903
hour-long session so that is the reason why I why I use my smartphone because it is not a problem. 

00:48:27.523 --> 00:48:32.483
It will not overheat. And my main problem is not storage, it's battery life. 

00:48:32.703 --> 00:48:38.723
So you really need to take care that you have a full loaded phone. 

00:48:39.403 --> 00:48:46.503
And you can, of course, also use an audio recorder, but then you don't have the picture. 

00:48:46.643 --> 00:48:51.183
That is the reason why I use the smartphone. It's easier. 

00:48:51.403 --> 00:48:54.903
And you have it with you already. 

00:48:55.163 --> 00:49:00.803
But of course, you can You can also use this. There are also tiny audio recorders 

00:49:00.803 --> 00:49:04.883
that you can also use to be independent. Maybe you need your phone during the call. 

00:49:05.763 --> 00:49:08.243
Okay, any more questions? 

00:49:11.603 --> 00:49:14.243
So thank you, thanks a lot!

00:49:19.483 --> 00:49:23.943
And grab one if you don't have one. Thanks to the sponsors.
