**Recommended videos**

- Career Tips from Sami Laiho (MCT Summit 2016)
  https://slideslive.com/38897951
  Very useful insights from Sami (in 2016!)
- Eine Paketverwaltung für Windows (Eine Geschichte voller Missverständnisse)
  https://vimeo.com/thorstenbutz/pssat2023
  This video was completely independently recorded with an iPhone, Camtasia screen recording and 2 filmmaker kits (2 speakers)
- Keynote: Microsoft schafft sich ab 
  https://vimeo.com/thorstenbutz/geekmania2018keynote
  An older recording (from 2018), not yet so sophisticated in technical terms, but very telling.
- PS Enigma - Thorsten Butz - PSConfEU 2023
  https://youtu.be/NZfmyKq-v6w
  Example transcript and curated subtitles based on Auphonic/Whisper.
  Curated = I corrected the subtitles and also added translation (via deepl.com)

- WinGet and Chocolatey: A Real-World Look at Package Manag. Tools - Paul Broadwith - PSConfEU 2023
  https://youtu.be/9qYqO9lkkpo
  Automated transcript and subtitles based on Auphonic/Whisper - not curated! 
  Since Paul has a notable Scottish accent, the quality of the transcript is very meaningful.

- about_VideoProcessing - Thorsten Butz - PSConfEU 2022
  https://youtu.be/i4watr8txOM
  I explain in great detail, how automated video processing with Auphonic (and other tools) work.
  If you want to know more about Auphonic and how I use it – this is the talk you should watch!
